# Sensors
## Types of Sensors Needed
We will be using several different types of sensors to collect different types of data needed for the autonomy stack. We will be using Lidars, cameras, IMU and GPS sensors all intergrated together to collect what is needed for the algorithims. A list of some basic functionality test as well as what type of data/sensor is needed to perform them can be seen below.

## Sensor Placement
The current plan for sensor location can be seen in the image below, however this is subject to change.
